# ScalaFinalProject :: EHR

The problem at hand is the amount of backlog and inefficiencies in the healthcare system at the moment. Consultation backlog and lapses in diagnoses are a real problem in this day and age which lead to a lot of people receiving ill advised medical care or none at all.

What we propose is to build a system which would create a network of hospitals, in an area, with a centralised database of information relating to patients and their medical history, hospital visits and medical track record, and to analyze that data to make the in place system more effective. We also want to create a client which would be able to predict patient trends, disease patterns and provide the doctor or physian with more information regarding the problem at hand but also about similar diseases and trends in the area. This would give the consulting physician more information to make an informed decision. 

In addition to that, design the client to create consultations bookings or reminders on behalf of the patients to create a system which is effective, reduces errors and that works for both patients and doctors.
