# ScalaFinalProject :: Airline Trends: Prices and Passengers

The travel industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, with quite rapidly fluctating prices and uncertainity. This can be quite frustrating from a consumer point of view, especially during peak seasons. Presently, the airline is consolidated with just a few major key players that allow them to fluctuate the prices at will.

We plan to analyze the past trends in the fickle industry and try to provide future predictions of how the prices will vary over days and weeks. We also plan to analyze the travelling patterns of people, especially during the holiday season and check how the industry also float their prices in response to the overwhelming number of people who travel.

In addition to the above analysis, we plan to provide a web UI which can act like a dashboard of aggregated results and provide recommnedations to the customer on when and which flight to book.
